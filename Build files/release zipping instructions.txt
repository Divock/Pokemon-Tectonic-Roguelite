These are the files used to create zip files of the game. Move them all into the containing folder to begin.

generate_patch_zip.bat will include only files that are different between the currently loaded GitHub branch and main.
generate_install_zip.bat will include all the files listed in install_files.txt

Neither of these "build" the game files. Run a full compile beforehand manually.

The way these batch files zip their files for some reason creates ZIPs that don't work well on Linux. Simply unzip them and re-zip them with another program to fix this issue.
